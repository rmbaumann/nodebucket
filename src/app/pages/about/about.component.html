      <p class="about">
        Nodebucket was a project created during a capstone class at Bellevue University
        in 2019. Nodebucket is a simple task management system that provides the means
        for individuals to track and complete tasks.

      <p class="about">
        Nodebucket provides the means to create, track, delete and complete everday tasks.
        The system was built using a MEAN stack, using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and
        Node. We combined a list of languages and skills to complete the project and also
        simulated a working enviornment, similar to what's actively found in the web development world.
        Professor Krasso created weekly sprints and used working meetings to create a
        world similar to what we will actively see once we graduate.

      <p class="about">
        To test nodebucket, Reva called in the Justice League and the likes of DC Comics
        to create a simple login system and example tasks for the League. These included tasks
        like:
        <ul>
          <li>Dryclean Superman's cape.</li>
          <li>Assign employee evaluations to Batman.</li>
          <li>Clean and service Justice League Jet.</li>
          <li>Hang up Wonder Woman's lasso.</li>
        </ul>
